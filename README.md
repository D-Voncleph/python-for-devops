# Python for DevOps

This repository serves as a collection of Python scripts and projects developed as part of my DevOps learning journey. The goal of these scripts is to demonstrate key concepts in automation, data handling, and system interaction using Python.

## Scripts

- **`fizzbuzz.py`**: A classic script that iterates from 1 to 100, demonstrating the use of `for` loops and conditional logic.

- **`validate_input.py`**: A script that asks for user input and validates whether it is a number or a string, showcasing user interaction and string methods.

- **`data_generator.py`**: A script that generates a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing a customer and containing a unique ID, name, and email. This project demonstrates the use of lists, dictionaries, and loops to generate structured data.

- **`parse_log.py`**: A script that reads a text file and prints out only the lines containing the word "error," demonstrating file handling and string searching.

- **`user_profile.py`**: A script that creates a dictionary and uses a `for` loop to print each key-value pair, demonstrating the use of dictionaries and the `.items()` method.

- **`stock_fetcher.py`**: A script that contains a reusable function to fetch real-time stock price data from a public API, demonstrating how to use the `requests` library and `JSON` data.

- **`zigzag.py`**: A personal project that creates a simple console animation, demonstrating the use of an infinite `while` loop and conditional logic.
