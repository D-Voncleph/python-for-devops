# Python for DevOps

This repository serves as a collection of Python scripts and projects developed as part of my DevOps learning journey. The goal of these scripts is to demonstrate key concepts in automation, data handling, and system interaction using Python.

## Scripts

- **`data_generator.py`**: A script that generates a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing a customer and containing a unique ID, name, and email. This is an enhanced version of the original script.

- **`fizzbuzz.py`**: A classic script that iterates from 1 to 100, demonstrating the use of `for` loops and conditional logic.

- **`validate_input.py`**: A script that asks for user input and validates whether it is a number or a string, showcasing user interaction and string methods.

- **`parse_log.py`**: A script that reads a text file and prints out only the lines containing the word "error," demonstrating file handling and string searching.

## Project: List of Dictionaries

This project focuses on a powerful and common data structure: **a list of dictionaries**.

* **The Structure:** A list of dictionaries is exactly what it sounds like. It's a single list that holds multiple dictionary objects. Each dictionary in the list is a self-contained record, like a row in a spreadsheet or a record from a database.

* **Why It's Useful:** This data structure is a key building block for working with real-world data in DevOps. It allows you to represent complex, structured data in your scripts. For example, when you retrieve information from a web API, it often comes back in this format. By using a list of dictionaries, you can easily access and manipulate each customer's details by their key (e.g., `customer['name']`).
