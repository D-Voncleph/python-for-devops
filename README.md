# Python for DevOps

This repository serves as a collection of Python scripts and projects developed as part of my DevOps learning journey. The goal of these scripts is to demonstrate key concepts in automation, data handling, and system interaction using Python.

## Python Fundamentals Demonstrated

This repository contains scripts that showcase the following foundational programming concepts.

### Variables and Lists

A **variable** is a name given to a storage location in memory. It allows you to store a single piece of information, such as a number or a string. A **list**, on the other hand, is a special type of variable that can store multiple items in an ordered collection, such as a list of names or numbers.

### Conditional Logic and Loops

* **Conditional Logic** (`if`, `elif`, `else`): This allows a program to make decisions. It checks if a condition is `True` or `False` and then executes a specific block of code based on the result.
* **Loops** (`for`, `while`): This allows a program to repeat a block of code multiple times. A `for` loop is used when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat an action, while a `while` loop is used when you want to repeat an action until a certain condition is met.

### The Importance of Indentation

In Python, **indentation is not optional**â€”it is a critical part of the syntax. Python uses indentation to define the scope of a code block. For example, all the lines inside an `if` statement or a `for` loop must be indented at the same level. If the indentation is incorrect, the program will not run.

## Scripts

* **`fizzbuzz.py`**: A classic script that iterates from 1 to 100, demonstrating the use of `for` loops and conditional logic.
* **`validate_input.py`**: A script that asks for user input and validates whether it is a number or a string, showcasing user interaction and string methods.
* **`data_generator.py`**: A script that generates a list of fake usernames using lists and the `random` module.

### How to Run the Scripts

All scripts can be run from the terminal using the Python 3 interpreter.

```bash
python3 <script_name>.py
